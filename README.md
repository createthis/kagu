This project is ancient history.

I started the project, but I wasn't the only developer. We were a team. The following
is my impression of the project alone and does not express the thoughts of the group:

Kagu Media is an old Python based media player we wrote back in 2006 for the Nokia N710 tablet.
The motivation for this project was to experiment with kinetic scrolling.

At the time, no
mobile devices featured kinetic scrolling. Pen stylus was the most common input method.
The Nokia N710 tablet was interesting because it featured wifi and a touch screen that did not
require a stylus to use. However, most of the shipped user interface featured buttons too small
to tap with a finger.

I had a long commute to and from work by car every day and I was using my N710 to play 
music and audio books during the trip. I quickly grew frustrated with the existing user
interfaces. I just wanted to use my finger and make quick swiping motions. The idea for
kinetic scrolling came to me and I started doing research and realized it was a thing
with a name, but no one used it in a windowing system yet.

Development started on Kagu Media and it attracted
a few other open source developers: Kemal, Francisco, Karl, and Tony, IIRC. We hung out
on IRC and worked on Kagu in our spare time, despite living in different timezones and
countries and continents. It was my introduction to remote work, I suppose, and I had a
great time. It wasn't until 2013 that I had another opportunity to work remotely. I felt
like we were breaking new ground in a lot of ways.

About a month into development the iPhone was announced, and guess what? It featured
kinetic scrolling. I was a little crushed, I must admit. Development continued for a 
while, culminating in the release of the Nokia N810 tablet. However, eventually it 
fizzled out when it became clear Maemo was a dead platform. Android and iOS were the
future.

Here's the original README from the project:

Kagu Media Player is a complete rewrite of Urho Konttori's ukmp.
Kagu is named after the endangered bird that also happens to serve as it's mascot: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagu
If K.A.G.U. was a recursive acronym (it's not), then it would stand for Kagu Ardently Granulates Ukmp, because Kagu is 
a rewrite of ukmp with a heavy focus on object oriented design.
